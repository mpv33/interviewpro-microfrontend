Our curated content covers crucial JavaScript topics, ensuring you have a strong foundation and are ready to excel.","-key-topics#ðŸ“š Key Topics":"","1-fundamentals#1. Fundamentals":"Data Types: Primitives (undefined, null, boolean, number, string, symbol, bigint) and reference types (objects, arrays, functions).\nType Coercion: Implicit and explicit conversions, and understanding == vs ===.\nScope: Global, function, and block scope; differences between var, let, and const.\nHoisting: Behavior of variable and function declarations.\nClosures: Functions retaining access to their lexical scope.\nES6 and ES14: Exploring Modern JavaScript Features: ES6 and ES14.","2-functions#2. Functions":"Understanding JavaScript Functions: Declarations , Expressions, Arrow Functions,IIFE.\nFunction Bind, Call, and Apply: Methods for controlling the context (this) of function execution.\nCurrying and Composition Functions: Techniques for transforming functions and arguments.\nPure Functions: Functions that are deterministic and have no side effects.\nHigher-Order Functions: Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.\nMemoization: Optimizing function calls by caching results.","3-objects-and-arrays#3. Objects and Arrays":"Object Manipulation: Creation using literal notation, constructors, and Object.create().\nArray Methods: Common methods including push(), pop(), map(), filter(), reduce().\nDestructuring: Extracting values from arrays and objects into variables.\nFlattening Arrays: Techniques for flattening nested arrays, including flat() method and recursion.\nFlatten obj:  Convert nested obj into a single-level obj.\nCloning Arrays: Methods for cloning arrays, such as slice(), the spread operator (...), and Array.from().\nCloning Objects: Techniques for cloning objects, including shallow copies using Object.assign(), spread operator (...), and deep cloning with libraries like Lodash or custom recursive methods.\nMerging Arrays and Objects: Combining multiple arrays or objects into one, and understanding the implications of shallow vs. deep merge.\nRemoving Duplicates: Techniques for removing duplicate values from arrays using Set, filter(), or custom logic.","4-prototypes-and-inheritance#4. Prototypes and Inheritance":"Prototypal Inheritance: Mechanism of inheriting properties and methods via the prototype chain.\nObject.create(): Create objects with a specified prototype for flexible inheritance.\nClasses (ES6): Using class syntax for defining constructors, methods, and inheritance.\nClass Inheritance: Extending classes with extends and overriding methods.\nPrototype Chain: How properties and methods are resolved through the chain.\nConstructor Functions: Creating objects and setting up prototypes with function constructors.\nObject.getPrototypeOf(): Retrieve an object's prototype.\nObject.setPrototypeOf(): Set an object's prototype (performance considerations).\nPrototype vs. Instance Methods: Differences between methods on prototypes vs. instances.\nPrototype Property (constructor): Role and usage of the constructor property.\nInheritance Patterns: Classical vs. prototypal inheritance.\nMixin Patterns: Combining behaviors from multiple sources into a single object.","5-asynchronous-javascript#5. Asynchronous JavaScript":"Event Loop: Understanding the call stack, callback queue, and message queue, and how they interact to handle asynchronous operations.\nPromises: Lifecycle (pending, fulfilled, rejected), chaining, and error handling.\nasync/await: Writing asynchronous code that looks synchronous, and handling errors with try/catch.\nCallback Functions: Using callbacks for asynchronous tasks and avoiding callback hell.\nPromise.all(): Handling multiple promises concurrently and waiting for all to resolve or any to reject.\nPromise.race(): Resolving or rejecting as soon as one of the promises resolves or rejects.\nPromise.allSettled(): Handling all promises when all have settled, regardless of their outcome.\nPromise.any(): Resolving when any of the promises fulfill, or rejecting if all are rejected.\nMicrotasks vs. Macrotasks: Understanding the difference between microtasks (e.g., promises) and macrotasks (e.g., setTimeout).\nError Propagation: How errors are propagated through promises and async functions.\nsetTimeout and setInterval: Scheduling tasks and their impact on the event loop.\nGenerators: Using generator functions for controlling asynchronous flow with yield and next().","6-dom-manipulation#6. DOM Manipulation":"Element Selection: Methods like getElementById(), querySelector().\nElement Modification: Changing text, attributes, and styles.\nEvent Handling: Adding, removing, and managing events.\nCreating and Inserting Elements: Dynamically adding new elements to the DOM.\nTraversing the DOM: Navigating between elements using properties like parentNode, childNodes, and nextSibling.\nEvent Bubbling and Capturing: Understanding how events propagate through the DOM.\nPerformance Considerations: Efficiently manipulating the DOM to avoid performance issues.\nShadow DOM: Encapsulation of DOM and CSS to create isolated components.\nEvent Delegation: Using a single event handler for multiple elements.\nAsync vs Defer: Understanding the differences between async and defer attributes in script tags.","7-performance-optimization#7. Performance Optimization":"Debouncing and Throttling: Techniques to optimize function execution, especially in events like input or scroll handling.\nMemory Management: Identifying and addressing memory leaks.\nLazy Loading: Load resources or components only when needed to improve performance.\nCode Splitting: Break down large JavaScript bundles into smaller chunks, improving load times.\nMinification and Compression: Reduce the size of JavaScript files for faster load times.\nTree Shaking: Remove unused code from your bundle to reduce the bundle size.\nEfficient DOM Manipulation: Minimize DOM updates for better performance.\nWeb Workers: Offload heavy tasks to background threads, preventing the main thread from being blocked.","8-advanced-javascript#8. Advanced JavaScript":"Polyfills: Implementing polyfills for methods like call, apply, bind, map, filter, reduce, and Promise.all.\nStrict Mode ('use strict'): Understanding and applying JavaScript's strict mode to enforce cleaner code.\nWeb Storage API: Using localStorage and sessionStorage for client-side data storage.\nTypeScript:  Most asked interview question on ts.","9-tricky-js-output-based#9. Tricky Js Output-Based":"In JavaScript interviews,understanding output-related questions is crucial.\nThese often involve tricky or non-intuitive behavior of the language","10-coding-challenges#10. Coding Challenges":"In JavaScript interviews, coding challenges test your problem-solving and algorithmic skills. These challenges often involve manipulating data structures, performing operations on strings and arrays, and solving complex problems efficiently.","array-manipulation#Array Manipulation":"","string-manipulation#String Manipulation":"","dom-challenges#DOM Challenges":"","-why-choose-interviewpro#ðŸŒŸ Why Choose InterviewPro?":"Focused Coverage: Key concepts essential for JavaScript interviews.\nClear Explanations: Practical examples and straightforward details.\nTargeted Practice: Frequently asked questions and interview preparation tips.\nConfidence Building: Equip yourself with the knowledge to excel.\n\nPrepare, practice, and succeed with InterviewPro.
