# 🚀 Upcoming Web Development Updates

Welcome to the roadmap for **InterviewPro Web Dev** — where we continuously improve your learning and interview preparation experience. Here's a sneak peek into what's coming soon.


## 💻 Real-Time Coding Playground (Coming Soon)

We're building an **interactive coding environment** — like LeetCode — right inside InterviewPro! 🚧

### Features:
- 🔐 **Code, run & test** directly in the browser
- 📋 **Topic-wise coding challenges** (JS, React, Next)
- 🧪 Built-in **test cases** for validation
- 🎯 **Hints, solutions, and time complexity analysis**
- 🧠 Track progress as you prep for interviews

> This will be integrated with the DSA + JavaScript sections first, followed by React use-case based coding scenarios.

## 🧪 Also In Progress
- Visual cheat sheets for JS & React
- System design corner (frontend-focused)
- Interview flashcards and whiteboard challenges
